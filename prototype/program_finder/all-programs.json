Those with BC high school chemistry 12 (or equivalent) normally start with CHEM 121. Major and honours students must fulfil program requirements below. Whether majoring in chemistry or not, students may not enrol in any CHEM course for which a D grade was obtained in any prerequisite.</p>\n<p>The following statements clarify and standardize the minimum requirements that a student must fulfil to complete a chemistry course as well as those to pass a combination lecture/laboratory course.</p>\n<h3>Course non-completion</h3>\n<p>The following will constitute non-completion of the required material in a chemistry course.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>not writing the final examination or its equivalent</li>\n<li>not completing the required minimum number of experiments in a laboratory course or the laboratory component of a course</li>\n<li>not completing additional or alternative material specified by the instructor</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The letter grade N will be awarded in these cases.</p>\n<p>Students must pass both the lecture and laboratory components individually to obtain a passing grade in lecture/laboratory combination courses.</p>",

The interdisciplinary seminars offer wide reading, careful reflection, and intense discussion. They are taught by faculty who are chosen for their expertise and teaching excellence, and for their interest in interdisciplinary studies. The program emphasizes a community of inquiry and discussion over independent research and entails several special expectations within the graduate study general regulations. Students should expect to participate in out-of-class activities, such as pre-class dinners, that encourage interchange and enhance intellectual community.</p>\n<p>Approved for part-time study, the program is designed for individuals having other obligations, and who may for that reason require greater or lesser amounts of time to complete the program.</p>",
